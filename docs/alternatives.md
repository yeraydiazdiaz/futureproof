# Alternatives

I am by no means the first person to address these problems. Here a few similar, more stable and feature full, albeit restrictively licensed alternatives:

- [Pebble](https://pebble.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), LGPL 3.0
- [more-executors](https://github.com/rohanpm/more-executors), GPL 3.0

`futureproof` is licensed MIT.
